## benefit of modularisation
- improve maintain
## data couping
- it's based on the fact that the communnicate by passing only data.
- then module are set to be data couple
- componenets are indepensent.
-  eg: customer willing
- the complete data structure is passed from to another one
- it involved trapped data and it was made by designer
 ## control couling
- module can communication by passing control communication
- ## external coupling 
- the moudle depent on other coupling to a particular type of hardware
- ## comman coupling 
- such as global data structure the change in global data tracking back to all modules
- which access ability to control data acess and reduce
- ##
- one module can modify the data of another module are control are control is passed form one module to another module
- this is the worst form of coupling
- ## sequential coupling
- it occur when output of one module depend of another module 
- this type of coupling can be diff to maintain and modify
- ## functionally coupling
- functionlly coupling occur when two  module depend on each  other  functionaaly
- tightly couped and diff maintain
